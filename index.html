             <b> “The aim of education is the knowledge, not of facts, but of values”.</b></p>
<br><br>
Dear Parents, Teachers, Patrons and well-wishers, 
<br><br>
Schools are opened, we are immensely happy to welcome all our kids back to the school. <br>
We shall be compliant to the SOPs and new COVID guidelines laid down by the government authorities and WHO to ensure that the students are safe at school. We shall remain adaptable and agile in our response to any changes that may come our way, with regards to the pandemic. 
<br><br>
Our school has just inaugurated the Diamond jubilee year moulding and transforming students into scholars, learning things to creative expression for the last 59 years. This institution has witnessed many stalwarts placed successfully in various fields around the Globe.
I take immense pleasure in stating the fact that the school has entered its 60th year in service – the year of the Diamond Jubilee and I express my heart-felt gratitude to every one of you who helped the school soar high in its ambition, while holding a strong footing in imparting good values to children through quality education. 
<br><br>
Embracing the new normal in the times of this pandemic has not been easy. The school was no exception to the multitude of challenges it had to face during a trying period as this. However, COVID-19, did teach us to look at life, from a different lens, re-instating in us the fact that how important it is for us to lead disease free, healthy lives. 
<br><br>
It is indeed a matter of pride that the school’s teachers and supporting staff are now 100% fully vaccinated, which renders our school safe and compliant to the COVID guidelines for re-opening. 
<br><br>
As an effort to motivate students in leading healthier lives, the school has recently opened a cardio park and gymnasium. Students shall receive guidance and consultation from trained professionals to help them on-board onto a balanced health regime. 
<br><br>
I will wish all the students the very best for their examinations, specially to the students of Classes 10th and 12th, who have not given up in their endeavours, even in tough times of the pandemic. 
<br><br>
Stay healthy and keep safe. 
<br><br>
Godspeed. 
<br><br>
Sr. Anjana <br>
Principal.

It is the month of March with magnolias in bloom and once again, its my sincere pleasure to welcome you all to flip through the pages of our 5th successful edition of the e-Magazine of St. Joseph's Convent Higher Secondary School. Six decades of existence is a remarkable accomplishment for the Josephites. Today, with our beloved school, poised on the threshold of a new era, as we stepped into the G0th year, we proudly look back in gratitude at the past that is fast receding behind us. Although the outbreak of Covid-1y, created a global health crisis, we were blessed to have the offline mode for a period of 5 months in 2020. Again, the new variants and the rate of contagion and pattern of transmission led to temporary shutdown of schools from the Gth of January 2022. to our relief they were reopened again from 2nd February 2022. 
                    <br>We were fortunate to conduct the inaugural ceremony of our foundation day on 11th February 2022 in the divine premises of our school. This is indeed a testament that despite the hardships, disruption and uncertainty brought by the pandemic. Our students were resilient to show their undisguised fondness for their school. Our proactive students did not deter from producing their creative skills The e-Platform acted as a facilitator to tune their sparks and to launch their potential.
                    <br>The students' familiarity and proficiency in the world of technology has helped us in the documentation of the e-Magazine. It chronicles the events and progress made by the Josephites through the past year that have unfolded in our campus. We hope to have encapsulated the works of our shining Josephites. This e-Magazine is our contribution to a long line of Josephites excellence. We eagerly look forward to your encouragement Principal Sr. Anjana in sustaining the momentum. I take this opportunity to thank all our students, staff and parents for creating such a vibrant, exciting and stimulating environment to lead the legacy of Josephites always in the frontier. It is our sincere hope that this kaleidoscopic e-Magazine will be a breath of fresh air and the beginning of a lifelong association.

The Year 2022 marks as a Diamond Jubilee year for St. Joseph’s Convent Hr. Sec. School  Sambalpur.
 Diamond Jubilee connotes a gracious 6 decades of instigation of this Educational Institute.
 The Celebration signifies recollection of the beautiful voyage of budding and blooming Josephite’s under the warmth and care of dedicated sisters, teachers and staff. Through the years the  school has fulfilled its  undertaking  of imparting intellectual, moral and spiritual values among the josephite’s which has helped them bloom  unreservedly and spread their vibrance wherever they go.
           <br> <br>
It was the year 1963, when Sisters of St. Joseph, Chambery, Nagpur Province came to Sambalpur and were approached by the Late Mr. Banmali Babu( then a social activist in Western Odisha). Their joint efforts laid the humble beginning of  St. Joseph’s Convent School on 11th February 1963.
           <br><br>
From the very modest beginning in 1963, under the able guidance of our yesteryears  principals, devoted teachers and staff  the school has grown into leaps and bounds, keeping pace with the ever-changing world, professionally, structurally, technically while maintaining its core values and virtues as intact as ever. 
           <br> <br>
The principals of St. josephs  have been the mainstay for this institute, Our present principal Sister. Anjana has continued this legacy, working tirelessly to bring more laurels to the institute. Even during the testing time of the corona pandemic under her gifted leadership and brilliant workforce the school, the staff and all josephite’s were able to sail through gracefully.
           <br><br>
The inaugural ceremony of the diamond jubilee celebration kickstarted with the tones of  bands, trumpets being played by the band squad while the Principal and Sisters received the NCC salute. The ceremony was largely conducted by the young and vivacious students of SJC who along with their guiding teachers toiled hard to make it a huge success.  With the milieu, filled with hymns and prayers Sister Anjana Lighted the paschal candle, followed by Lighting of the lamp by Sister Damian, Sister Teresa, Agomany Mam, and Sir D.P. Sharma which marked the unrolling of yearlong celebration. This followed hoisting of school flag and everyone singing in unison the school anthem.
                    The school logo was unveiled this followed a number of online and offline events by students of SJC.  The events had participants ranging from tiny tots of class1  to  our young adults of class10th.
           <br><br>
The young Picasso’s from Grade 1,2,4 and 5 exhibited their artistic skills in the form of paintings honouring our Patron Saint, St. Joseph , our institution and its motto. class 6 th had competition to compose hymns on St.Joseph our Patron Saint. Grade 3 had a creative writing competition honouring the virtues of St. joseph, Grade 7th displayed their culinary skills in the competition ‘Cooking without Fire’. Grade 8th and 9th participated in the elocution competition, displaying the principles of articulation, inflection, accent and emphasis and last but not the least Grade 10th students conducted a very lively and vibrant Quiz Competition, named ‘Tarrant’. The young wizards rocked the platform exhibiting their brilliance in all the rounds. And not just this there was an interschool volleyball match organised within the school premises.<br><br>
                    
Later, a newly built cardio park and gymnasium was inaugurated by Father Petrus Kullu, Provincial of SVD, INE Province.<br><br>
Friends, the ceremony came to an end but the spirit of celebration and enthusiasm continues. With the school moto “Virtue Alone Ennobles”, engraved in our minds and souls we continue our journey forward into the future always striving to be worthy carriers of the great legacy. 
           
<br> <br>Thank You.<br>
 Sheetal Sakalle.
